The primary objective of the toolkit is to provide an easily accessible repository of drone-related open-source software, data, AI models, standards, courseware, and guides that address the SDGs.\nAll the products in the toolkit must be open source and eligible for nomination as a Digital Public Good.\nThe Drones for SDG toolkit target audience:   Users of solutions, content such as the UN, other humanitarian agencies, Governments, policymakers, program directors, and private sector drone practitioners or startups.\n  Developers of relevant drone solutions that are looking to increase visibility and use of their solutions; or are looking to build on existing open-source code for development of new applications.   How to make a contribution to the Drones for SDGs Toolkit What are Digital Public Goods? The Digital Public Goods Standard is a set of specifications and guidelines designed to maximise consensus about whether a digital solution conforms to the definition of a digital public good: open-source software, open data, open AI models, open standards, and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable best practices, do no harm by design and are of high relevance for attainment of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This definition stems from the UN Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation.\nThe DPG Standard establishes the baseline requirements that must be met in order to earn recognition as a digital public good (DPG). This standard is designed to complement other relevant principles such as the Principles for Digital Development and is applicable to DPGs in all sectors across the SDGs. The DPG Standard is itself an open project, open to contribution on GitHub, and developed in collaboration with organisations and experts.\nWho We Are The Digital Public Goods Alliance is a multi-stakeholder initiative with a mission to accelerate the attainment of the sustainable development goals in low- and middle-income countries by facilitating the discovery, development, use of, and investment in digital public goods.\nIncubated by The Government of Norway and The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the DPGA relies on engagement and leadership from pathfinder countries, private sector technology experts, think tanks, governments, philanthropic donors, international implementing organizations, and the UN.\nThe DPGA is governed by an Interim Strategy Group consisting of: The Government of Sierra Leone; The Government of Norway; iSPIRT; and UNICEF. Day to day functions are steered by the Secretariat of the Digital Public Goods Alliance, which is co-hosted by UNICEF and Norad.\nThe DPGA also uses a Roadmap as a coordination, alignment, engagement and communication tool to capture the activities of DPGA members working to significantly advance the four DPGA strategic objectives described in the our 5 year strategy. Members include: members of the ISG; BMZ; GitHub; The Office of the Secretary-General’s Envoy on Technology; UNDP; and UN Global Pulse.\nFor more information, visit the Digital Public Goods Alliance.\n</p>",

The “Analytics” section of this toolkit centres on curating drone-related artificial intelligence and data products that inform decision-making. Areas where these drone analytics tools are used include surveillance, research, operations, project management and impact evaluation.\nBioverse Labs (Brazil): Using drones and AI to support the sustainability of the Amazonian ecosystem At Bioverse Labs, the team uses drone imagery and machine learning to identify and map non-timber species of trees (e.g., chestnut, copaiba, and Brazil nuts) in the Trombetas River basin in Para State in Northern Brazil. Bioverse aims to identify tree species that support food security and economic growth for the indegenious communities in the region. This methodology, and accompanying sustainable agro-forestry management plan will provide communities with a more direct connection to renewable income sources.\nUse Bioverse labs GitHub Repository (Click here) qAira (Peru): Using drones to monitor air quality from illegal mining areas in Peru The team at qAIRa aim to assess air quality in Madre de Dios, through the measurement of pollutants; increase air quality monitoring in rural areas; create awareness about the quality of the air people breathe and its effects on health.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, new data shows that 9 out of 10 people breathe air ontaining high levels of pollutants with an estimated 7 million deaths every year from exposure to polluted air causing diseases such as respiratory infection, heart disease and pneumonia.\nOur technological solutions are connected to the internet, withstand harsh environmental conditions and are cost-effective compared to traditional solutions because they perform monitoring in larger areas and in less time.\nUse qAira GitHub Repository (Click here) Rentadrone (Chile): Using aerial thermal imagery and machine learning for clean energy and agriculture uses Rentadrone detects, classifies, and organizes errors and damaged modules in solar power panels using thermal aerial imagery to increase energy efficiency of solar power plants. Our team will also explore an alternate use-case of thermal imagery for agriculture and will collect and label aerial photos of crops which will be used to automatically detect diseases on crops.\nUsing thermal aerial imagery, our team detects little defaults that are represented by hot spots in solar panels. These hotspots can make the solar plants less efficient resulting in less energy output. Throughout our development process we realized the same technologies can be applied to detecting diseases in crops.\nUse Rentadrone GitHub Repository (Click here) Submit open datasets to the UNICEF drones for SDGs toolkit Do you have an open source collection of drone images or other data?\nJoin our efforts to make innovation for good more accessible and to scale impactful tools across the world.

UNICEF Supply Division provides technical expertise, country implementation support, and donor coordination and works with Regional and Country Offices and their governmental partners to scale up the use of innovative services and solutions as a part of supply chain operations.\nAs shown by several UNICEF projects in Malawi and Vanuatu, drone delivery offers an impactful last mile solution:\n Use of drones can lead to 65 % reduction in turnaround times of diagnostic samples (samples delivered on time, not expiring, effective diagnostics), and up to 130 % increase in diagnostic sample collection, that leads to more patients being effectively treated (in Malawi). Reduction of delivery time from 1-2 days to 30-60 minutes. (in Vanuatu) Improved compliance\/adherence with immunization and treatment schedules\/campaigns, introducing services that wouldn’t be available otherwise (in Vanuatu). Drone delivery can help minimize the vaccine (and other health commodity) stockout levels and increase general availability of health commodities at the healthfacility level. (in Vanuatu and Malawi). Reducing the health facility dependency on storage capacity and storage equipment (in Vanuatu). Other benefits observed by UNICEF partners included: Drone delivery bundled with other innovative interventions can offer a cost effective solution for disease (TB) control (based on WHO CEA methodologies) Drone delivery could decrease transport costs if the drones are used frequently enough to overcome the capital costs of installing and maintaining the system.  </p>",

Understand the existing ecosystem\n  Step 2. Design with the user\n  Step 3. Address privacy and security\n  Step 4. Be collaborative\n  Final checklist for the ethical use of geospatial technologies\n  Introduction Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), or drones, offer the potential to improve humanitarian assistance and the living conditions of local communities by delivering life-saving medical supplies in hard-to-reach areas; collecting aerial imagery that helps map risks to strengthen resilience, improve agricultural yields or water management, among other use cases in the humanitarian and development sectors. Drones offer the possibility to better meet the needs of those living in disadvantaged conditions or affected by humanitarian crises; however, this can only be achieved if drones are used in a responsible and ethical manner.\nThe use of UAS to support humanitarian and development operations must always consider the interests, perceptions and concerns of the people the mission aims to serve; and therefore should always adhere to the humanitarian imperative of doing no harm. Doing this will require assessment and mitigation of potential unintended consequences that UAS operations may have on affected communities and humanitarian action. UAS deployments in the humanitarian and development sector must observe the humanitarian ethical principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.\n4 steps for deploying UAS in humanitarian missions As with other technology applied to address social challenges, the use of UAS should consider the nine principles of digital innovation when working with people and communities in need. UNICEF, partners and service providers working with drones should follow these four practical steps in their mission planning and development:\nStep 1: Understand the existing ecosystem.  Consider the particular structures and needs that exist in each country, region and community. Dedicate time and resources to analyze the ecosystem, or context where the UAS mission will be deployed, to ensure that the use of this technology will be relevant and sustainable. Consider and comply with the existing legal and regulatory frameworks.  Step 2: Design with the user.  Get to know the people you are serving through conversation, observation and co-creation. Ensure the UAS-based solution is sensitive to, and useful for, the most marginalized populations: women, children, those with disabilities, and those affected by conflict and disaster. Engage with these communities at different stages of the project: planning, development, implementation and assessment.  Step 3: Address privacy and security.  Assess and mitigate risks to the security of people and their data. Consider the context and needs for privacy of personally identifiable information when designing the UAS use case, and mitigate accordingly.  Step 4: Be collaborative.  Share information, insights, strategies and resources across projects, organizations and sectors, leading to increased efficiency and impact. Coordination is a multi-stakeholder process. This means that lessons learned and best practices on the use and coordination of UAS in humanitarian settings must remain open and transparent. Use open standards, open source, open innovation tools. An open approach to the use of UAS in humanitarian and development missions helps increase collaboration in the UAS for good community and avoids duplicating work.  Step 1. Understand the existing ecosystem\nStep 2. Design with the user\nStep 3. Address privacy and security\nStep 4. Be collaborative\nFinal checklist for the ethical use of geospatial technologies** Before deploying drones for a humanitarian or development mission to collect data, UNICEF, partners and service providers should reflect on the following questions to ensure UNICEF is able to garner the benefits of these technologies, while also protecting the children and communities it serves.\nThis checklist should be completed by any party who will be using drones in collaboration with UNICEF. The UNICEF Drones Working Group will assess the responses and establish an ad-hoc framework for assessing the risks, harms and benefits of opening this specific dataset.\n1. Identifying the benefits of using geospatial technologies for evidence generation    Tick = Yes Cross = No Questions Description      Have you considered the nature of the data that could be collected or mapped via these technologies and the potential demand for and use of this data within the context of current strategic planning?     Can you clearly specify the benefits of using geospatial technologies for your particular purposes? Is this supported by the evidence (where available)?     Do you have staff with capabilities and expertise to responsibly lead and undertake the work and to develop, utilize, manage and analyse technologies and data in a timely and useful way?     Have you considered the availability and comparative utility of other data\/information prior to collecting data via geospatial technologies or from third party providers?     2. Ensuring privacy and security    Tick = Yes Cross = No Questions Description      Have you reviewed data to ensure that individually identifiable information is removed or obscured?     Have you reflected on privacy and ensured the highest possible privacy conditions throughout each stage of the project?     Are you aware of the privacy policies of any organization whose data or platforms you are using? Including:     - Any anonymization or aggregation of data undertaken by the third party (preferred).     - The nature and security of storage.     - Whether provisions exist relating to individuals’ ownership of data. In the absence of these, clear and public disclosure should be considered with regard to the use of this data.     Is the third party you are receiving data from domiciled in a country with broad surveillance powers? If yes, have you considered the risks and benefits to the populations involved?     3. Understanding the data risks and limitations    Tick = Yes Cross = No Questions Description      Have you discussed with data providers and data analysts the value and limitations of the data?     Have you considered the potential for discrimination relating to individuals being geographically categorized?     Have you considered the potential for discrimination resulting from any application of machine learning algorithms?     4. Assessing other potential harms    Tick = Yes Cross = No Questions Description      Have you made contingency plans in case:     - Data is wiped out remotely, or     - A privacy breach occurs.     Have you provided sufficient information or training for crowdmapping participants on potential risks and protection strategies?     Have you provided clear information to potential crowdmappers as to what will or will not be undertaken consequent to findings provided by crowdmapping?     5. Engaging communities    Tick = Yes Cross = No Questions Description      Have you undertaken a consultative process involving all relevant stakeholders to produce a risk assessment framework?     If not, have you, at a minimum, informed (in the context of social media based programmes) relevant communities to let them know about the evidence generation programme?     Do you have a means by which community consent might be obtained from the target communities?     Do you have a means by which data can be shared with the target communities?     6. Assessing risks and mitigation strategies for geospatial data collection from UAS    Tick = Yes Cross = No Questions Description      Are you intending to use an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in a conflict zone\/fragile state?     If yes, what is the justification?     Is it absolutely essential?     What relevant authority units will be supporting teams on the ground?     Do the benefits outweigh the risks – have you made a determination based on a comprehensive assessment of security and safety issues and potential perceptions of the organization and its personnel if you send a UAV into this context?     Have you set up systems that avoid recording any information that would present a security threat to individuals and groups if intercepted?     Have you adopted approaches that minimize the resolution of visual data captured (including maximizing the distance between object and visual imaging technology) to ensure the lowest resolution while maintaining the value of the data captured?     Irrespective of context, have you planned to engage with the communities in the visible path of the UAV and\/or to notify and\/or discuss the launch of the UAV?     Are you intending to launch and land the UAV from the location to be surveyed?     If landing is to be remote at a different location, is there a plan for having a recovery team available at the remote site so that the UAV (and data collected) does not fall into the hands of the wrong people?     </p>",
