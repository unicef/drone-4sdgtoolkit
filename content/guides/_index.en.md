**“Reuse and Improve”**.

The global drone industry has been developing for decades and the lessons learned from various stakeholders can be a guide for future innovation.
UNICEF and several other stakeholders have made significant contributions to the global knowledge base of the technology and use of drones in the development and humanitarian contexts specifically.
The “Guides” section is a collection of case studies, annual reports, and action guides for achieving specific outcomes.

## Guides

## Technical Guide - The use of drones in humanitarian and development missions

The use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) to support humanitarian and development operations must always consider the interests, perceptions and concerns of the people the mission aims to serve; and therefore should always adhere to the humanitarian imperative of doing no harm. Doing this will require assessment and mitigation of potential unintended consequences that UAS operations may have on affected communities and humanitarian action. UAS deployments in the humanitarian and development sector must observe the humanitarian ethical principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.

This guide is a summary of UNICEF’s intervention design process for drone interventions in humanitarian and development contexts.

## Technical Guide – Satellite vs Drones for Imagery Data

Today, aerial imagery is available from a variety of sources, including traditional satellites, nano satellites, manned and unmanned aircrafts, balloons, and kites. This imagery can benefit humanitarian organisations in programme implementation, resource planning, community studies, and disaster response.

Previously, the process of developing maps from imagery was painstakingly slow and it required a great deal of time from highly technically skilled individuals to patch differently formatted images together.

This decision making guide aims to take the acquired knowledge from UNICEF’s use of satellites and drones for imagery collection and provide a guide on the different technologies as well as when to use a particular mode over the other.
