The UNICEF Drones for Sustainable Develop Goals Toolkit is a collection of tools curated by the Office of Innovation.
The primary objective of the toolkit is to provide an easily accessible repository of drone-related open-source software, data, AI models, standards, courseware, and guides that address the SDGs.
All the products in the toolkit must be open source and eligible for nomination as a Digital Public Good. 

The toolkit has two main audiences:

1. Users of solutions, content such as the UN, other humanitarian agencies, Governments, policymakers, program directors, and private sector drone practitioners or startups.
1. Developers of relevant drone solutions that are looking to increase visibility and use of their solutions; or are looking to build on existing open-source code for development of new applications.
