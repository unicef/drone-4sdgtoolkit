**“Build for sustainability” and “Do no harm”**.

Drones operate in public airspace, which is a very sensitive environment.
This presents unique challenges and risks.
National Civil Aviation Authorities handle the management of public airspace with support from the International Civil Aviation Organization.
The “Regulations” section of the toolkit houses several international best practice documents for the safe management, monitoring and control of drone operations in public airspace.
